CV - Tic-tac-toe game analysis
Your task is to analyze the images of the tic-tac-toe game, find the winner and draw the line that
crosses the row of 3 marks (X or O).
Deliverable:
● Working code (it should be possible to install all the necessary packages to run it from
requirements.txt using pip),
● A short report [in English] on the principle of operation of your solution (better with some
illustrations),
● The initial game images with the line that crosses the straight line of 3 same marks.
