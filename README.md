# Tic-Tac-Toe Game Analysis

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Game Analysis project! This project aims to classify Tic-Tac-Toe game images, determine the winner, and draw a line that crosses the row of three marks (X or O).

## Getting Started

Before diving into the project, make sure you have the necessary datasets or images for analysis.

### Using `inference.py`

The `inference.py` script is your gateway to analyzing Tic-Tac-Toe game images and determining the winner. Here's how to use it:

1. **Prepare Your Images**:
   - Place the Tic-Tac-Toe game images you want to analyze in a folder.

2. **Run Inference**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the project directory.

3. **Execute the Script**:
   - Run the `inference.py` script:

     ```bash
     python inference.py
     ```

   It will ask you to write input_image.jpg and output_image.jpg.
   Replace `input_image.jpg` with the path to your input image and `output_image.jpg` with the desired output path.

4. **Review Results**:
   - The script will analyze the image, determine the winner, and draw the winning line.
   - You will find the annotated image at the specified output path.

## Training Code

If you wish to explore the training code, you are welcome to do so! However, please note:

- **Training Cells**: Be cautious when running the training cells.

- **Load Preprocessed Data**: You can run cells with data preprocessing.

- **Load Pretrained Models**: If you prefer, you can load pretrained models to see how they perform with images. There is a code to do so in training jupyter notebooks.

- **Inspect Predictions**: Use code cells where you can see predicted images to inspect and visualize the model's predictions on sample images.
